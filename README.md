# movie-recommendation-gen

We have created an application collaboratively called:
Flick Genie

Purpose:

This application was made to be a Movie Suggestion Generator.
It helps the user find movies that they search for through the navigation application. 
Or program uses two free API interfaces to generate the search results.
It also contains a short About me and a Carousel at the bottom which shows the user's search history/recent findings. 


Here are the websites we used to reference our code:
we3schools.com
geeks4geeks.org



used to help create the Carousel for LocalItemStorage
