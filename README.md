# Movie-Recommendation-Generation

We have created an application collaboratively called:
--------------------Flick Genie-----------------------

Purpose:
This application was made to be a Movie Suggestion Generator.
It helps the user find movies that they search for through the navigation application.
Our program uses three free API interfaces to generate the search results.
It also contains a short About me and a recently view at the bottom which shows the user's search history/recent findings.
